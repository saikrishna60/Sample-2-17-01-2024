<p>links pointing to a document indicate the popularity of the document, while links coming<br/>
out of a document indicate the richness or perhaps the variety of topics covered in the<br/>
document. The PageRank (Brin & Page, 1998) and CLEVER (Chakrabarti et al., 1999)<br/>
methods take advantage of the information conveyed by the links to find pertinent Web<br/>
pages. Counters of hyperlinks, into and out of documents, retrace the structure of the<br/>
Web artifacts summarized.</p>

<p><i>Web-usage mining</i>. Yet another major area in the broad spectrum of Web mining is<br/>
Web-usage mining. Rather than looking at the content pages or the underlying structure,<br/>
Web-usage mining is focused on Web user behavior or, more specifically, modeling and<br/>
predicting how a user will use and interact with the Web. In general, this form of mining<br/>
examines secondary data, or the data that are derived from the interaction of users (Chen,<br/>
Park, & Yu, 1996). There are two main thrusts in Web-usage mining: general access-<br/>
pattern tracking and customized-usage tracking. General access-pattern tracking ana-<br/>
lyzes Web logs in order to better understand access patterns and trends. Customized-<br/>
usage tracking analyzes individual trends. Its purpose is to customize websites to users.<br/>
The information displayed, the depth of the site structure, and the format of the resources<br/>
can all be dynamically customized for each user over time, based on their patterns of<br/>
access (Kosala & Blockeel, 2000).</p>

<p>Srivastava, Cooley, Deshpe, and Tan. (2000) have produced a taxonomy of different<br/>
Web-mining applications and have categorized them into the following types</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <i>Personalization</i>. The goal here is to produce a more “individualized” experience<br/>
for a Web visitor, including making recommendations about other pages to visit<br/>
based on the pages he/she has visited previously.</li></p>

<p><li> <i>System improvement</i>. Performance and speed have always been important factors<br/>
when it comes to computing systems, and through Web-usage data, it is possible<br/>
to improve system performance by creating policies and using such methods as<br/>
load-balancing, Web caching and network transmission.</li></p>

<p><li>Site modification. It is also possible to modify aspects of a site based on user<br/>
patterns and behavior. After a detailed analysis of a user’s activities on a site, it<br/>
is possible to make design changes and structural modifications to site to enhance<br/>
a user’s satisfaction and the site’s usability.</li></p>

<p><li><i>Business intelligence</i>. Another important application of Web-usage mining is the<br/>
ability to mine for marketing intelligence information. Buchner and Mulvenna.<br/>
(1998) used a data hypercube to consolidate Web-usage data together with<br/>
marketing data to obtain insights with regards to e-commerce</li></p>

<p><li><i>Usage characterization</i>. There is a close relationship between DM of Web-usage<br/>
data and Web-usage characterization research. This area is focused more on such<br/>
topics as interaction with the browser interface, navigational strategies, the<br/>
occurrence of certain types of activities, and models of Web usage. Studies in this<br/>
area include Catledge and Pitkow (1995), Doorenbos, Etzioni, and Weld (1996), and<br/>
Arlitt and Williamson (1997).</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Yet another area that has been gaining interest is agent-based approaches. Agents<br/>
are intelligent software components that “crawl through” the Internet and collect useful<br/>
information, much like the way a virus-like worm moves through systems wreaking havoc</p>
