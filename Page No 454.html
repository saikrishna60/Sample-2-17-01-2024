<p>Generally, agent-based Web-mining systems can be placed into three main categories:<br/>
information categorization and filtering, intelligent search agents, and personal agents.<br/>
<i>Information filtering/categorization</i> agents try to automatically retrieve, filter, and<br/>
categorize discovered information by using various information-retrieval techniques.<br/>
Agents that can be classified in this category include HyPursuit (Weiss et al., 1996) and<br/>
Bookmark Organizer (BO).<i> Intelligent search agents</i> search the Internet for relevant<br/>
information and use characteristics of a particular domain to organize and interpret the<br/>
discovered information. Some of the better known include ParaSite, and FAQ-Finder.<br/>
<i>Personalized Web agents</i> try to obtain or learn user preferences and discover Web<br/>
information sources that correspond to these preferences, and possibly those of other<br/>
individuals with similar interests, using collaborative filtering. Systems in this class<br/>
include Netperceptions, WebWatcher (Armstrong, Freitag, Joachims, & Mitchell, 1995),<br/>
and Syskill & Webert (Pazzani, Muramatsu & Billsus, 1996).</p>

<h2>TEXT DATA MINING (TDM)</h2>

<p>The possibilities for DM from textual information are largely untapped, making it a<br/>
fertile area of future research. Text expresses a vast, rich range of information, but in its<br/>
original, raw form is difficult to analyze or mine automatically. TDM has relatively fewer<br/>
research projects and commercial products compared to other DM areas. As expected,<br/>
TDM is a natural extension of traditional DM, as well as information archeology<br/>
(Brachman et al., 1993). While most standard DM applications tend to be automated<br/>
discovery of trends and patterns across large DBs and data sets, in the case of text mining,<br/>
the goal is to look for pattern and trends, like nuggets of data in large amounts of text<br/>
(Hearst, 1999).</p>

<p><h3>Benefits of TDM</h3></p>

<p>It is important to differentiate between TDM and information access (or information<br/>
retrieval, as it is better known). The goal of information access is to help users find<br/>
documents that satisfy their information needs (Baeza-Yates & Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). Text<br/>
mining focuses on how to use a body of textual information as a large knowledge base<br/>
from which one can extract new, never-before encountered information (Craven, DiPasquo,<br/>
Freitag, McCallum, Mitchell, Nigam & Slattery, 1998). However, the results of certain<br/>
types of text processing can yield tools that indirectly aid in the information-access<br/>
process. Examples include text clustering to create thematic overviews of text collections<br/>
(Rennison, 1994; Wise, Thomas, Pennock, Lantrip, Pottier, & Schur, 1995), automatically<br/>
generating term associations to aid in query expansion (Voorhees, 1994; Xu & Croft,<br/>
1996), and using co-citation analysis to find general topics within a collection or identify<br/>
central Web pages (Hearst, 1999; Kleinberg, 1998; Larson, 1996;).</p>

<p><h3>Methods of TDM</h3></p>

<p>Some of the major methods of TDM include feature extraction, clustering, and<br/>
categorization. Feature extraction, which is the mining of text within a document, attempts</p>
