<p>and potentially useful patterns and implicit information from artifacts or activity related<br/>
to the WWW (Etzioni, 1996). The main tasks that comprise Web mining include retrieving<br/>
Web documents, selection and processing of Web information, pattern discovery in<br/>
sites and across sites, and analysis of the patterns found (Garofalis, Rastogi, Seshadri<br/>
& Shim, 1999; Kosala & Blockeel, 2000; Han, Zaiane, Chee, & Chiang, 2000).</p>

<p>Web mining can be categorized into three separate areas: web-content mining,<br/>
Web-structure mining, and Web-usage mining. Web-content mining is the process of<br/>
extracting knowledge from the content of documents or their descriptions. This includes<br/>
the mining of Web text documents, which is a form of resource discovery based on the<br/>
indexing of concepts, sometimes using agent-based technology. Web-structure mining<br/>
is the process of inferring knowledge from the links and organizations in the WWW.<br/>
Finally, Web-usage mining, also known as Web-log mining, is the process of extracting<br/>
interesting patterns in Web-access logs and other Web-usage information (Borges &<br/>
Levene, 1999; Kosala & Blockeel, 2000; Madria, Bhowmick, Ng, & Lim, 1999).</P>

<p><i>Web-content mining</i> is concerned with the discovery of new information and<br/>
knowledge from web-based data, documents, and pages. According to Kosala and<br/>
Blockeel (2000), there are two main approaches to Web-content mining: an information<br/>
retrieval view and a database (DB) view. The information retrieval view is designed to<br/>
work with both unstructured (free text, such as news stories) or semistructured docu-<br/>
ments (with both HTML and hyperlinked data), and attempts to identify patterns and<br/>
models based on an analysis of the documents, using such techniques as clustering,<br/>
classification, finding text patterns, and extraction rules (Billsus & Pazzani, 1999; Frank,<br/>
Paynter, Witten, Gutwin & Nevill-Manning, 1998; Nahm & Mooney, 2000). The other<br/>
main approach, which is to content mine semi-structured documents, uses many of the<br/>
same techniques as used for unstructured documents, but with the added complexity and<br/>
challenge of analyzing documents containing a variety of media elements (Crimmins &<br/>
Smeator, 1999; Shavlik & Elassi-Rad, 1998).</p>

<p>There are also applications that focus on the design of languages, which provide<br/>
better querying of DBs containing web-based data. Researchers have developed many<br/>
<i>web-oriented query languages</i> that attempt to extend standard DB query languages<br/>
such as SQL to collect data from the WWW, e.g., WebLog and WebSQL. The TSIMMIS<br/>
system (Chawathe et al., 1994) extracts data from heterogeneous and semistructured<br/>
information sources and correlates them to generate an integrated DB representation of<br/>
the extracted information (Maarek & Ben Shaul, 1996; Han, 1996; Meldelzon, Mihaila, &<br/>
Milo, 1996; Merialdo, Atzeni, & Mecca, 1997).</p>

<p>Other applications focus on the building and management of<i> multilevel or multi-<br/>
layered DBs</i>. This suggests a multilevel-DB approach to organizing web-based informa-<br/>
tion. The main idea behind this method is that the lowest level of the DB contains primitive<br/>
semistructured information stored in various Web repositories, such as hypertext<br/>
documents. At the higher level(s), metadata or generalizations are extracted from lower<br/>
levels and organized in structured collections such as relational or object-oriented DBs.<br/>
Kholsa, Kuhn, and Soparkar (1996) and King and Novak (1996) have done research in this<br/>
area.</p>

<p><i>Web-structure mining</i>. Instead of looking at the text and data on the pages<br/>
themselves, Web-structure mining has as its goal the mining of knowledge from the<br/>
structure of websites. More specifically, it attempts to examine the structures that exist<br/>
between documents on a website, such as hyperlinks and other linkages. For instance,</p>
