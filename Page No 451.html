<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>

<p><i>Every day, enormous amounts of information are generated from all sectors, whether<br/>
it be business, education, the scientific community, the World Wide Web (WWW), or one<br/>
of many readily available off-line and online data sources. From all of this, which<br/>
represents a sizable repository of data and information, it is possible to generate<br/>
worthwhile and usable knowledge. As a result, the field of Data Mining (DM) and<br/>
knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) has grown in leaps and bounds and has<br/>
shown great potential for the future (Han & Kamber, 2001). The purpose of this chapter<br/>
is to survey many of the critical and future trends in the field of DM, with a focus on those<br>
which are thought to have the most promise and applicability to future DM applications</i></p>


<h2>MAJOR TRENDS IN TECHNOLOGIES AND<br/>
METHODS: WEB MINING</h2>

<p>Web mining is one of the most promising areas in DM, because the Internet and<br/>
WWW are dynamic sources of information. Web mining is the extraction of interesting</p>
